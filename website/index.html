<h4>Facts about flowers</h4>
	<p>Carnivorous plants are flowering plants that eat bugs and small animals! For example, the Venus fly trap has leaves covered by little hairs. When a bug lands on the hairs, the trap snaps shut and digestive juices digest the bug. Other carnivorous plants such as pitcher plants have leaves that form pitchers that are full of digestive fluids. Insects, frogs, and other small creatures are attracted to the nectar and bright colors on the pitchers and flowers.
	 Some unfortunate critters fall in, drown, and are digested.</p>

<h4>Fun facts about flowers</h4>Not all flowers smell good.
	<p>One of the world's rarest, largest, smelliest, and strangest looking flower is the titan arum, or the corpse flower.
	It is called the corpse flower because it smells like a rotting dead body. The bloom is over 8 foot tall and 12 feet in circumference. They smell like rotting flesh in order to attract flies, their preferred pollinator.
	People have been known to pass out from the smell!</p>
<p>The largest Flower in the world is the flower of the Puya raimondii,
	which has a flower stalk 35,000 feet tall and bears over 8,000 white flowers.</p>
